Setting up your database:
First you will need to run MySQL in either a terminal (for Mac users), or command line (for Windows users).

mysql -u root -p
After this you will need to create your first database, lets call this new one "lyrics":

create database lyrics;
After this, you will need to select the newly created database:

use lyrics;
After this you will need to download the following file: Lyric.sqlLinks to an external site.. This file is a script to create the Lyric database that we will be using for the majority of this class.

To run this script, you can either open it up in a text editor and copy paste everything into your terminal/command prompt/workbench, or you can run the following code:

source PATH/TO/FILE/Lyric.sql
This will create all of the tables and records for the Lyric database. Save this Lyric.sql file just in case if you need to recreate the database for whatever reason.

An alternative to this is to open the Lyric.sql file in a text editor like notepad or notepad++, then copy the FULL contents of the Lyric.sql file, and paste it into your terminal/command prompt/Mysql

workbench. This will also install the database information in your newly created database.
