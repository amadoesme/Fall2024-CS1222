  				{ $count: "total" }
                             ])

4. What is the highest ipouts value in the pitching collection? (Hint, you will need to group by the entire collection. You will also need to filter out players that don't have an ipout)
ANSWER: db.pitching.aggregate([
  				{ $match: 
                                         { ipouts: 
                                                   { $exists: true 
                                                   } 
                                         } 
                                },
  				{ $group: 
                                         { _id: null, 
                                          maxIpouts: 
                                                    { $max: "$ipouts" 
                                                    } 
                                         } 
                                }
                             ])

5. Find the average year in the whole pitching collection
ANSWER: db.pitching.aggregate([
  				{ $group: 
                                         { _id: null, 
                                           avgYear: 
                                                   { $avg: "$year"

                             ])

6. Group the players by year and return the average ipouts per year
ANSWER: db.pitching.aggregate([

                                 }
			     ])

7. Group by year and player_id and then order by the number of players in each grouping
ANSWER: db.pitching.aggregate([
  				{ $group: 
                                         { _id: 
                                               { year: "$year", 
                                                 player_id: "$player_id" 
                                               }, 
                                          count: 
                                                { $sum: 1 
                                                } 
                                         }

                                        } 
                                }
